The game has horror aesthetic, but is not a horror game.
We as the player can interact with various objects, and see where it takes us!
I added reverb to most of the sounds to match the atmosphere, which made the game feel juicer.

I do not have any UI Sounds, since I do not have any ui elements in my game
